# projectile-simulator
A basic projectile simulation where the user enters variables and a simulation plays based on it, along with results.
You might also be able to do Physics homework with it.
Or just have a good time and watch silly stuff happen.

To run the main file directly from the command prompt, simply edit the cmd.exe by going to properties and changing the "Start In" to the directory the folder is located in.  Then, run the program by typing: python main.py


**IMPORTANT:**
You must install pygame before running the program.  To do this, first go to your command prompt, and then type pip install pygame.  Wait for the installation to finish and then you can run the program.
